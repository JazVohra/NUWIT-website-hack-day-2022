go through the repoo and change some things

1. open bare bones folder
2. HTML is a language that helps define the structure and content of a webpage
3. HTML document has a bunch of HTMl components
3. each component has a tag (i.e. h1)
4. content of a component is in between the opening and closing tag. 
5. Content of a component can be text (i.e. hello, world) or an html component (i.e. the content of body is the h1)
5a. can nest/organize coed accordingly

Context of document
doctype tells browser to render it as an html document
everything in between html tags
two main sections: head and body
head: metadata that the browser needs to render page directly but not see directly on page. 
body: what you actually see on the website

meta:
charset defines characters used
name line: ensures the page can be seen on laptop and mobile
title: label seen on tab
description: what would show up as description of website if you looked it up on google. 

link: to css style

CSS: make website look pretty (format, color, font, etc.)

Go over tags:
h1, p, img, div
div way to organize page into sections

Start with CSS:
1. reference something in CSS with it's tag
body {
    color: blue;
    background-color: aliceblue;
}
affects entire page

if we want to get more specific and just affect the hello world, we can reference it with the h1 tag
h1 {
    color: pink
}

what if we have two h1 tags and we only want one of them to be pink or if we just want them to have different styling?
1. class or id in tag (id must be unique in a document, classes can be used multiple times)
2. surround with a div and assign the div a class so it can be referenced in the CSS doctype

Delete everything in body and start from scratch
start with image:
1. download image
2. image does not need a closing tag
<img src="nuwit.jpeg" alt="">
<h1> Hi, I'm Emily and I'm part of NUWIT </h1>
<p> This is the html page for the HTML/CSS tutorial</p>

then css:
1. assign different classes to tags
2. wrap in div w container class (contains everything)
3. font colors, displac in container
** display: block (each element takes a new line), inline (each file tries to be in the same line), flex (flexible to where children arranged in)
flex:
- row (default): tries to fit children in same row
- column: puts all elements in a column

** if have time go over google fonts **
4. add div around text ot group it together 
5. add class text to div
- add background color
