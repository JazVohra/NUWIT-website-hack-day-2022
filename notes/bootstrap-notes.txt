1. go over file structure -- same as last one + some bootstrap library things

grid system (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/grid/)
1. split screen into columns and rows: look agt columns first
2. in bootstrap, everything surrounded by container div
3. class name indicative of size of column
4. give an example:

<div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col green">
                
            </div>
            <div class="col red">
                
            </div>
            <div class="col blue">
                
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

Since the class is col, each element will have an equal length. 
add info into each column and then show.
